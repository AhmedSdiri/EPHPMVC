h1. EPHPMVC: A small but extendable MVC implementation for PHP 5.3

h2. Design Goals

h3. General
 * Component should scale: from small web app to huge complex web projects
 * Configuration over convention but sensible defaults
 * Should be extendible with classic OOP measures: e.g. @Composites@ (GOF 163) could be used for complex views and complex routes
 * Constructor based dependency injection for all the classes
 * No singletons, no registries, multiple @Front Controllers@ (P of EAA 344) should live easily together
 * Basic structure fully defined in interfaces
 * Clear separation of packages
   * @EPHPMVC\Standard@ is where the most simple example implementations live
   * HTTP protocol specific implementations live in @EPHPMVC\HTTP@

h3. Dispatching/Routing
 * Protocol agnostic: should be usable for Web, Mail processing, CLI utilities

h3. View
 * Use closures as view helpers
 * View helpers are conceptually the same as template variables
 * Use PHP as the default template engine (no Smarty, no nothing)

h2. Ideas
 * Implement an A/B split testing route
 * Implement a CLI request/response/route triangle
 * Implement XML processing request/response/route triangle. Routing expressions specified as XPath Queries
 * Implement router to use @Page Controller@ (P of EAA 333) pattern
