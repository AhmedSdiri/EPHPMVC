h1. EPHPMVC: A small but extendable MVC implementation for PHP 5.3

h2. Design Goals
 * Protocol agnostic: should be usable for Web, Mail processing, CLI utilities
 * Component should scale: from small web app to huge complex web projects
 * Configuration over convention but sensible defaults
 * Should be extendible with classic OOP measures: e.g. Composites could be used for layouts and mixed routes
